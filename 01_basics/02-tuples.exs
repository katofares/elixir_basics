# A tuple is an ordered collection of values
{1, 3}
{"foo", "bar", 2}
{:ok, "next", 100}

# A typical Elixir tuple has two to four elements—any more
# and you’ll probably want to look at maps,, or structs

# In elixir all function returns tuple where:
# the first element is :ok if were no errors
# the first element is :error if there is an error
