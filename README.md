## Recursion 
* Recursive functions are the core of repetition in functional programming. 
* A recursive function is when a function calls itself, leading to successive calls of the same function.

#### Recursion types:
  - ***Bounded recursion:*** The most common type where the function will call
    itself till reach the end (the given        parameter).
  - ***Conquering recursion:*** There are tow techniques :
    * ***Decrease and Conquer :*** is a technique for reducing a problem to its simplest    form and starting to solve it incrementally
    
    * ***Divide and Conquer:*** is about separating the problem into two or more parts     that can be processed independently and can be combined in the end 

## Higher-order functions:
* higher-order functions are functions have functions in their arguments and/or      can return functions.
