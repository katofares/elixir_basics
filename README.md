## Recursion ##
* Recursive functions are the core of repetition in functional programming. 
* A recursive function is when a function calls itself, leading to successive calls of the same function.

#### Recursion types:
  - Bounded recursion: The most common type where the function will call
    itself till reach the end (the given parameter)
